It is true, we as a software engineer, software developer or whatever other title companies give to the programmers, only have basic knowledge, at least on my experience, about the programming world. 

Here I will try to give some advises and path to follow to become a good software engineer, or programmer, or called whatever you want, in this website I command and I will call it software engineer.
